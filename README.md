# Three-address-code
<p>
Three address code is a type of intermediate code which is easy to
          generate and can be easily converted to machine code.It makes use of
          at most three addresses and one operator to represent an expression
          and the value computed at each instruction is stored in temporary
          variable generated by compiler. The compiler decides the order of
          operation given by three address code
